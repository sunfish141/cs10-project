    <p>
      Chess is one of my favourite strategy games, due to it involving prior
      thought for every move. I like the thought required to play the game
      effectively.

      Waterton is one of my favourite places in Alberta. It has beautiful
      scenery and mountains for hiking year-round. I appreciate the natural
      beauty of this natural park.

      Burgers are my favourite food due to their variety and taste. I appreciate
